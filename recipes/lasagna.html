    <p>Homemade lasagna is the best. Each layer of this lasagna is thoughtfully composed to balance flavors and textures. The sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef offer a rich, meaty base, complemented by the subtle sharpness of white onion and the warmth of minced garlic.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li> 
        <li>1 large white onion (diced)</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cooling: Allow your cooked lasagna to cool to room temperature. Freezing it while hot can lead to condensation, resulting in a soggy texture upon reheating.</li> 
        <li>Portioning: Consider cutting the lasagna into individual portions. This makes it easier to thaw and reheat only what you need, reducing waste.</li>
        <li>Wrapping: Wrap each portion tightly with plastic wrap, ensuring that itâ€™s sealed well to prevent freezer burn. Then, wrap it again with aluminum foil for added protection.</li>
        <li>Labeling: Label each portion with the date. Lasagna can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 months.</li>
    </ol>
