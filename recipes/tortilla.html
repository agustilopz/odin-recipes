    <p>Potatoes, onion, zucchini/courgette and red pepper are the filling for this simple Spanish Omelette</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cups (75 ml) vegetable oil</li>
        <li>12 ounces (340 grams) about 3 medium potatoes, peeled</li> 
        <li>2 cups (205 grams) white onion, peeled, cut half and sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (50 grams) red or green bell peppers</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (60 grams) zucchini/courgette, chopped small</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the potatoes in half, then into quarters and slice.</li> 
        <li>Add oil to a 9-10-inch (23-26 cm) non-stick frying pan over medium heat. The oil is ready when you drop a piece of potato in and it sizzles (you donâ€™ want it too hot). Add the potatoes and onion. Cook without browning, for a couple of minutes, then the add bell pepper and cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs and vegetables to a large bowl and mix well.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tablespoons of the drained oil back into the same pan and return to medium heat. When the oil is hot, carefully pour the egg/potato mix into the pan and smooth into an even layer. Cover with a lid, this will help it cook faster. Cook for, 10-15 minutes until the bottom is browned and starts to set. Once the edges start to set, I like to use a rubber spatula to carefully lift it a little to make sure it is not getting too brown on the bottom. If it is, turn down the heat slightly.</li>
        <li>Once the top has started to set (but still a little liquid in the center), place a plate over the pan, that is larger. Carefully, but quickly, flip the omelette onto the plate, then slide back into the pan. Use your spatula to reshape if it got a little messy. Replace the lid and cook for a further 5-6 minutes if you like the center set. Cook less if you like the center soft.</li>
        <li>Slide out into a board and allow to cool slightly before cutting and serving.</li>
    </ol>
